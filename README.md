# website-refactoring
In this assignment, i refactored the website to fit the guidelines specified by the README. 
I consolidated the repeated classes and used the semantic tags to clean up the code and make it cohesive.
I also fixed the accessibility so that when the user clicks all buttons it sends them to the appropriate section of the page.
